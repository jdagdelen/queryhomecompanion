This field contains sub-keys for the various methodologies (GGA/GGA+U). Within each methodology is stored a pointer to a pymatgen band structure object that is stored in a GridFS (fs_id key). Thus, these sub-keys contain a link to the band structure object, but not the object itself.

This band structure is a dense uniform k-point mesh (not along symmetry lines).
